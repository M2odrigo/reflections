When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In case that the computer broke or if Im working on multiple computers with the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to explicit a message in each commit, and also each commit
have to do only one logical change/bug fix to keep the track and someday 
want to see where something goes wrong

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: to clone someone else repository into my account and start to make changes and/or share with someone who wants to collaborate with me. Useful when are not permissions to update or push my own changes to certain repository, also the account who's own the repository keep a track of the project
    Clones: make a copy of a repository into a computer from a remote or from another place in the same computer
    Branches: works only with one repository, when you want to test some functions/changes without affecting the current state

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To make changes to it in offline mode, so later on we can use the git fetch to see the diff between our out-of-sync changes and those commited to the master on github

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
